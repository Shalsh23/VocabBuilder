### Core Philosophy

- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new data sources
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and resume capabilities
- **Efficiency**: Intelligent caching and duplicate detection
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large vocabulary datasets
- **User-Friendly**: Simple CLI with clear progress indicators

            <h2>üìö Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Some people collect stamps or pressed flowers. We collect words. Not in haste, but in the way you might collect seashells on a quiet morning‚Äîturning each one over, marveling at its shape, feeling the weight of its history.

WordOtter is for those who find joy in this kind of lingering. It's for people who read a sentence twice, not because they didn't understand it, but because it felt too good to leave behind. For those who smile when they meet sonder or halcyon in the wild, and tuck it away for later use.

We believe words are not mere instruments of communication‚Äîthey are the tools with which we think, dream, and build the architecture of our inner worlds. Learning them should feel less like homework and more like stepping into a well-lit room you didn't know was in your own home.</p>
